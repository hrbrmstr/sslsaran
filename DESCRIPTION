Description: The 'IETF' 'RFC' 6962 (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962>) 
    describe experimental protocol for publicly logging
    the existence of 'Transport Layer Security' ('TLS') certificates as they
    are issued or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit
    certificate authority ('CA') activity and notice the issuance of
    suspect certificates as well as to audit the certificate logs themselves.
    Functions are provided as a wrapper around the log server 'API'.
